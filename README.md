I am a Computer Science (AIML) undergraduate at GD Goenka University with a strong interest in software development.

Currently, I am focused on strengthening my fundamentals in:
• Core Java & Advanced Java
• Data Structures and Algorithms
• Object-Oriented Programming
• Problem Solving

I am also building academic and personal projects to apply my knowledge practically and improve my coding skills.

I am actively seeking internship opportunities and entry-level roles where I can learn, grow, and contribute as a software engineer.
